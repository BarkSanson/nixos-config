# My NixOS configuration
This repository is intended to hold my NixOS configuration. I'm pretty new
to the Nix and NixOS environment, so this configuration is much likely trash. 

If anyone wants to use this configuration (for whatever reason, since
there are many other configurations that are much better than this), is free
to use it.

# Features
I try to keep my system as minimalist as possible, with some exceptions. The main
components of the environment are:
- Hyprland
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Zsh
- Neovim
- Wofi

Other programs are also included, such as Firefox or VS Code. Feel free to dive into
the configuration and tweak whatever you want.

I'm also working in adding more features, since the system is usable but is lacking some 
programs and services that would be great to have. Also I will work on a Python script
to be able to change the theme and appearence of the system, mainly Hyprland, Waybar and Wofi,
but I will first try to figure out how to build a complete system that fits exactly my needs.

# Contributions
Any advice or contribution is very welcome, since I want to keep learning about NixOS.
